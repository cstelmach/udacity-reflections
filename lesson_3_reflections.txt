When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  Whenever I work on projects with other people, on not-propriatary projects, when there might
  be a change in location, when I want a saved copy online (because of it's importance), want
  to show others the projects, etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

  Just like making commits only at logical steps the same is true for the opposite: There could be
  updates which break your local version, either because your version differs significantly from
  the remote repository or because team members have comitted changes which break your changes. Both
  of which would essentially force a merge, which is not something you want to do without supervision.
