What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	With git init you create git repository and add a .git file, which keeps 
	track of your commits, making version control possible. 
	You need to to it to show which folder, which files are in the git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

	The working directory is simply all the files in the folder that are not commited.
	The staging area are those files improtant to have version control. They are "pre-commit"
	and you are thus able to commit in logical steps, by selecting related files rather than
	committing everything everytime arbitrarily. 
	the files selected commitable, thus enables version control and all it's benefits.
